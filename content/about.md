## TL;DR  

This site is named after a nickname that I have been using since the year 2000. How I got from that year, to where we are now is explained in a lot more detail below, if you happen to be interested in stuff like that.

In real life I am named Khôi Lê and I work as a project manager and agilist. Skills that are not that useful in creating this site, so I'll just have to manage with the other skills I have taught myself over the many years since birth.

From here onwards, we get into the lengthy bit.
